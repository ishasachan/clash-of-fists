# CLASH OF FISTS 
## Overview

The Rock Paper Scissors game is a classic and timeless game enjoyed by people of all ages. This project aims to develop an interactive and real-time multiplayer version of the Rock Paper Scissors game using React and [Socket.io](http://socket.io/). The game will allow players to compete against each other in a virtual environment, testing their skills and luck.

## Features

1. Lobby System: The project will implement a lobby system where players can join and create game rooms. Each game room will accommodate two players who will compete against each other.
2. Real-Time Gameplay: The game will utilize the Socket.io library to establish real-time communication between players. This means that players will be able to see their opponent's moves instantly and the game results will be displayed immediately.
3. Player Interaction: The project will allow players to interact with each other during the game. They can send messages, emojis, or use a chat system to communicate and create a more engaging experience.
4. Game Logic: The Rock Paper Scissors game logic will be implemented on the server-side to ensure fairness and prevent cheating. The server will determine the winner based on the chosen moves of the players.
5. Leaderboard and Statistics: The project will keep track of players' game statistics, including the number of wins, losses, and ties. A leaderboard will be displayed to showcase the top-performing players.
6. Responsive UI: The user interface will be designed using React to ensure a responsive and user-friendly experience. It will be compatible with different devices and screen sizes, including desktop and mobile.
7. Styling and Visuals: The project will incorporate appealing visuals and animations to enhance the gameplay experience and make it visually engaging.
